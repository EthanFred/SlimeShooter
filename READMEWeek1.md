All assets can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU
This was also the tutorial used to create this game.
The watch time for this tutorial was about 2 hours

I used this tutorial for understanding knockback: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnI8LUDXz0
I took about 15 minutes to watch this tutorial

I used AI for this assignment, the conversation can be found next to this README file.

I messed up my GitHub commits, however I do have a breakdown of how long each change took:

Adding knockback ~ 1 hour
- I first tried adding an animation, before learning about lerp()

Using the mouse cursor to point the weapon ~ 15 minutes

Shooting when the player presses the left moust button ~ 45 minutes
